# Particle-in-a-Box-Simulation


A simple notebook created in Jupyter to simulate the physics case for a particle in a 3D box.
The waveforms in the first cell can be played around with.


Notebook is written in python, utilizing the NumPy and Plotly libraries to artificially generate and visualize the probability distribution.


Credits for the functionality of the notebook go to my professor.
